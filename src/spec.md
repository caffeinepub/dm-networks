# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a public About/Onboarding section explaining DM Networks and consistently attribute the project to DMC Technologies.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a publicly accessible About/Onboarding view/section reachable from the main UI (e.g., header or footer) without requiring sign-in.
- Write English About/Onboarding content explaining what DM Networks is, how to sign in with Internet Identity, how profiles are used for display names, and how chat messaging works/visibility for authenticated users.
- Include a clear “Managed by DMC Technologies” attribution with a clickable external link to https://www.dmc-technologies.fr (opens in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
- Update the global layout/footer to show the DMC Technologies attribution consistently while keeping existing branding links already present (e.g., caffeine.ai), maintaining readability on mobile and desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** Signed-out users can open an About/Onboarding section to understand the project and how to use it, and all users see a consistent “Managed by DMC Technologies” attribution with a working link to the DMC Technologies website.
